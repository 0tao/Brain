LIBRARY OVERVIEW
================
Brain is an Arduino Library for parsing data from Neurosky-based EEG units. Tested units include the Star Wars Force Trainer and Mattel MindFlex.

It's designed to make it simple to send out an ASCII string of comma-separated values over serial, or to access processed brain wave information directly in your Arduino sketch. See the examples for code demonstrating each use case.

Instructions for the hardware-end of this hack are available here: http://example.com

The .getCSV() function returns a string (well, char*) listing the most recent brain data, in the following format:
"signal strength, attention, meditation, delta, theta, low alpha, high alpha, low beta, high beta, low gamma, high gamma"

Signal strength ranges from 0 - 200. Counterintuitively, 0 means the unit has connected successfully, and 200 means there is no signal.

The attention and meditation values both run from 0 - 100. Intuitively, higher numbers represent more attention or meditation.

The EEG power values — delta, theta, etc... - are a heavily filtered representation of the relative activity in different brain wavelengths. These values can not be mapped directly to physical values (e.g. volts), but are still of use when considered over time or relative to each other.


INSTALLATION
============
Decompress the zip and drag "Brain" folder to Arduino's "libraries" folder inside your sketch folder. (On the mac, this is ~/Documents/Arduino by default. You may need to create this folder if it does not exist.) Restart the Arduino environment.


MINUTIAE
========
Note that the connection to the Neurosky headset is half-duplex — it will use up the RX pin on your Arduino, but you will still be able to send data back to a PC via USB. (Although in this case you won't be able to send data to the Arduino from the PC.)

You may wish to read brain data over a software serial connection instead of the Arduino's hardware serial (this frees up the hardware serial for full-duplex operation). I've tested the library with the Software Serial library distributed with the Arduino environment, and also with the excellent NewSoftSerial library (http://arduiniana.org/libraries/NewSoftSerial), it works fine with both. HOWEVER, switching from the default hardware serial to software serial requires modification of the brain library. I'm looking for a more flexible solution, but for now feel free to contact me if you need help reconfiguring the library to work with software serial.

The MindFlex provides access to more brain data than the Force Trainer — in addition to the signal strength, attention and meditation values, the MindFlex gives access to 8 bands of EEG power data.

Brain data comes in quite slowly... expect a fresh packet every second or so.
